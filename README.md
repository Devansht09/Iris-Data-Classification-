Yo, so this project i made. i trained 3 models on the iris dataset, and now you can add your own dataset in the end, and yeah try to see what type of category it falls into. do check the accuracy level of each model if ur gonna do it 
also added the dataset as a csv file and its alr there in the source code as a csv link
