Yo, so this project i made. i trained 3 models on the iris dataset (easily found on net, i found it thru github itself). 
Now, i also made a nice frontend UI for it, where you can enter your flower details, select a model to evaluate it and it will pop back with a nice answer and a confidence score (basically the accuracy). 
How to operate? download the whole thing, open terminal from the folder, and type these 2 commands : 
1. pip install flask scikit-learn pandas
2. python app.py
Enjoy!!
